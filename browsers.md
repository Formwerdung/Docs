# List of Supported Browsers 

> Status 7/11/2015

These are the browsers that we support out of the box in each of our projects, chosen by the following criteria:

- Usage Percentage in Switzerland > 0.5% 
- Browser does not lack significant features *or* exhibits feature declaration bugs (IE 8, Safari 6.1)
- Browser is a test release

We aim for a coverage of 90% in usage percentage. Note that the actual coverage is higher because 1) certain browsers are not accounted for in the statistics and 2) not testing for a browser does not necessarily imply that it the website is *not* displayed properly supported. just because we. Other browsers must be agreed upon individually. "Support" does not imply that site look the same on all browsers, principles of graceful degradation are applied.
