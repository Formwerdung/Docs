# List of Supported Browsers 

> Status 20/07/2016

These are the browsers that we support out of the box in each of our projects, chosen by the following criteria:

- Last two major releases + Firefor ESR
- Usage Percentage in Switzerland > 0.5% 
- Browser does not lack significant features *or* exhibits feature declaration bugs (IE 8, Safari 6.1)
- Browser is a test release
- Official support

We aim for a coverage of 90% in usage percentage. Note that the actual coverage is likely be higher because 1) certain browsers are not accounted for in the statistics and 2) not testing for a browser does not imply that the website is *not* displayed properly. "Support" does not imply that the site will look the same on all browsers, principles of graceful degradation are applied. For more info, check the [general remarks]().
